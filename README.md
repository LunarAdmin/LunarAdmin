# Lunar Admin
Lunar Admin is a new and innovative admin system for ROBLOX. With an extensive library of over 100 commands, Lunar Admin provides users with the ability to customize their gaming experience in every way imaginable.
## Security
### Server-Side
<img align="right" height="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128256644/228689987-3ff75beb-a8de-4a41-9233-ff5869a05e93.jpg">
Lunar's prioritization of security is evident in its development approach, which places a strong emphasis on server-side scripting. By minimizing the amount of code that runs on the client-side, Lunar reduces the potential for vulnerabilities in its system and helps to ensure that your game remains secure. Furthermore, Lunar has taken the additional step of avoiding client-to-server communication, as this type of interaction can be particularly vulnerable to exploits.

### Anti-AA 
We understand that admin abuse attacks can be a significant concern for those who manage online communities, and we take this issue very seriously. Our team has worked tirelessly to develop a robust system that addresses this concern and ensures that our platform is a safe and secure space for all users.
One of the key features of our system is the extensive logging of all kicks and bans. Not only are these actions logged within ROBLOX, but they are also recorded on Discord through the use of a webhook. This allows for complete transparency and accountability, as all administrators and moderators can view the logs and ensure that all actions taken are appropriate and justified. In addition to the logging feature, our system also incorporates strict limits on the number of bans that can be executed within a minute. This measure helps to prevent any potential abuse of power, as any attempts to exceed this limit are promptly flagged and logged. By imposing these limits, we are able to maintain a fair and just environment for all users. Furthermore, our system includes a sophisticated verification process that must be completed before any bans can be executed. This ensures that all bans are carried out accurately and only in cases where they are truly necessary. Even if a player leaves the server during the verification process, our system is designed to save their username so that they can still be banned at a later time, if necessary.
Finally, it's worth noting that our system is continually being updated and improved to address any potential security concerns. We are constantly monitoring our platform for any signs of abuse or misconduct, and we are committed to taking swift and decisive action to address any issues that arise. In summary, we understand that admin abuse attacks are a real concern for online communities, and we have implemented a comprehensive system that addresses this issue and ensures the safety and security of our platform. With extensive logging, strict limits, and a thorough verification process, our system is designed to prevent abuse of power and maintain a fair and just environment for all users.
