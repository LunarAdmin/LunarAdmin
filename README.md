We understand you're worried about admin abuse attacks, but no more need to worry! All kicks / bans will be logged inside ROBLOX, and also on discord through the use of a webhook. Lunar also will limit you to how many bans you can do a minute, if someone tries to surpass this limit, it will be logged and you can see all the people they have banned / kicked. Additionaly, they will have to go through a verification system to ban someone, if the player leaves well they are verifying, out systems will save the username, this also means you can ban people who aren't in your server ( if you have the set role of course )
