We understand that you may have concerns regarding the possibility of admin abuse attacks. However, we would like to reassure you that there is no need to worry anymore! Our system has implemented measures to ensure that all kicks and bans are logged within ROBLOX, as well as on Discord through the use of a webhook. Additionally, our system has imposed limits on the number of bans that can be executed within a minute. Should anyone attempt to surpass this limit, it will be promptly logged, and you can access information regarding all the individuals who have been banned or kicked. Moreover, a verification system has been put in place to ensure that all bans are executed accurately. If a player leaves during the verification process, our system will save their username, which means that you can still ban them, even if they are not currently in your server (provided that you have the required role). With all these measures in place, you can rest easy knowing that our system is designed to prevent admin abuse attacks and ensure a safe and secure gaming environment for all users.
